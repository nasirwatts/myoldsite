                    I can be of value to your business as an employee, or you're considering hiring me to build your professional

                    can discuss how I can help make you money and how you can help me by giving me another excuse to do what
                    I love. Thank you!

              <p>
                Coding responsive HTML emails for variable data campaigns. My job is to design, develop, deploy, test, 
                and track email campaigns for FrontGate and GrandinRoads.

              <p>
                Expert in web and application development using a variety of
                development tools to assure a precise, clean, and professional

                you, from barbershops/salons to restaurant owners to freelance
                instructors. The <i>Do it yourself</i> drag and drop sites are
                pretty darn cool, I say myself. But if you'd like to work
                directly with someone who helps you with your updates and
                consultation along the way, <strong>I'm your guy!</strong>
